# react-photo-gallery

## Overview:

This is a photo carousel, built in React, with responsive design optimized for desktop viewing.

## Get It Running Locally:

After cloning down the repo, enter the following in the command line:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then navigate to localhost:3001 in your browser.

## Test The Functionality!

Try the following:

- Click the left/right arrows
- Click on a photo carousel photo
- Use your left and right arrow keys
- Hover over the left/right arrows and carousel photos
- Resize the browser window

#### To-dos:

I still need to handle the following edge cases:
- Photos with different aspect ratios/sizes
- No photos

To improve the code quality:
- Add props validation
- Add tests
